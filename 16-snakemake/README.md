# Introduction to Snakemake

At this lesson we have
 - Replicated some results from Angrist & Krueger (1991): Does compulsory school attendance affect schooling and earnings?
 - Used Snakemake to make the build process automated (from downloading the data to producing the final pdf)
 - Tracked the history of our project using Git and Github

By the end of this session, you should have a Github repo of your own containing your in class work. In addition, you can find
 - The repo I have created during the class [here](https://github.com/stanmart/ak-replication-2022) (probably similar to yours)
 - A somewhat more extensive version of the same project containing some extras (a quarto presentation, regressions, fancy model jsons etc.) [here](https://github.com/pp4rs/snakemake-2022). You should probably use this one if you need a reference project for Snakemake.
